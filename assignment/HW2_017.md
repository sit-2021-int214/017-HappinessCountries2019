# Assignment 2 (Group)

Explore 2 dataset that given then finding descriptive statistics and summary result in form of sentences/paragraph at least 5 topics.

---

## Pre-requisites

1.) Type `install.packages("")` and a package name with **DescTools** for descriptive statistics and **MASS** for support functions and datasets in each package and run these codes.

```{R}
# DescTools package
install.packages("DescTools")

# MASS package
install.packages("MASS")
```

2.) Type `library()` and a library name with **DescTools** and **MASS** in each library for use functions and datasets and run these codes.

```{R}
# DescTools library
library(DescTools)

# MASS library
library(MASS)
```

## Package helps

See the package details for helping in each package

```{R}
# DescTools package
help(package=DescTools)

# OR

# MASS package
help(package=MASS)
```

## Answer

### Cats dataset

1.) Convert the mean of cats body weight by kilograms (kg) to pounds (lb) and use this formula __lb=kg*2.2046__.

```{R}
meankg <- mean(cats$Bwt)
meankg * 2.2046
```

2.) From the cats table, the average of female cat heart weight in grams.

```{R}
avg_hwt_f <- mean(cats [cats$sex == "F","Hwt"])
print(avg_hwt_f)
```

3.) Total body weight of female cat is 110.9 kg and Total body weight of male cat is 281.3 kg.

```{R}
s1 <- sum(cats[cats$Sex=="F", "Bwt"])
s2 <- sum(cats[cats$Sex=="M", "Bwt"])
cat("Total weight of female cat is ",s1)
cat("Total weight of male cat is ",s2)
```

### Survey dataset

4.) Show the columns who has status like "Regul" and display the table by use `View()`.

```{R}
survey$Smoke="Regul"
View(survey)
```

5.) Students who have abnormal heart rate (Normal is between 60 to 100 bpm ) are 12 people.

```{R}
summary (survey$pulse<60) : Heart Rate Under 60 bpm = 10 
summary (survey$pulse>100) : Heart Rate Over 100 = 2
```

6.) In survay dataset have male = 118, female = 118 and unidentify = 1.

```{R}
student <- factor(survey$Sex)
summary(student)
```
